# school-presentations
A place where I can make presentations through Marp and Markdown

---

## What is this?
So, I've recently discovered that Marp exists. This allows me to do stuff like:
* Creating presentations exclusively with Markdown
* Typing into Github to make stuff like presentations

All of this results in me doing this very efficiently.

There you go.

## Rules

Find the folder you need. Only commit to the project at hand.
(Yes, I have multiple projects in one folder. Please don't try and vandalise them. You can create as many pull requests as you want, but I"ll only commit them if they actually contribute something.)
