A place where I can make presentations through Marp and Markdown

## What is this?
So, I've recently discovered that Marp exists. This allows me to do stuff like:
* Creating presentations exclusively with Markdown
* Typing into Github to make stuff like presentations

All of this results in me doing this very efficiently.

## Why does this exist?

There you go.

## Recommended Tools
* Visual Studio Code -- you'll need it to access Marp (and see what it looks like once it's done)
  * Available on the web at [vscode.dev](vscode.dev)
  * Available for Windows, macOS, and most distros of Linux on [VS Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  * After you're done, install the Marp extension. (works on desktop and web)
  * Don't forget to commit your changes! (That's right, no autosave!)
* Github Desktop (easy access to Git, but it is built into VSCode) (optional)
  * Get it on [Github Desktop's website](https://desktop.github.com) (only supported on Windows + macOS)

We can always work on Google Slides or MS Sway, but I find this easier to use.

## Generally Helpful Stuff
* [Chris Ayers](https://chris-ayers.com/2023/03/31/customizing-marp) has a really good page on how to format images. 
* [Marp](https://marpit.marp.app/directives) has a page on directives (so you don't ruin the entire presentation with an orange background or something.)
* You can take a look at some of the various examples I've put here.

**(P.S: I'll probably take care of the formatting and backgrounds, so don't worry)**

## Rules

Find the folder you need. Only commit to the project at hand.
(Yes, I have multiple projects in one folder. Please don't try and vandalise them. You can create as many pull requests as you want, but I'll only commit them if they actually contribute something.)

## That should be everything!
You can find a bunch of example slides below.
